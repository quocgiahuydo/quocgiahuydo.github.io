        <p>

            Bornean orangutan populations have declined by more than 50% over the past 60 years, and the species' habitat has been reduced by at least 55% over the past 20 years.
            
           </p>

           <p>  The Bornean orangutan differs in appearance from the Sumatran orangutan, with a broader face and shorter beard and also slightly darker in color. Three subspecies are recognized, each localized to different parts of the island:
            
             <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Northwest Bornean orangutans are the most threatened subspecies. Its habitat has been seriously affected by logging and hunting, and a mere 1,500 individuals or so remain. Many habitat patches in the area are small and fragmented.</li>
                <li>Northeast Bornean orangutans are the smallest in size and found in Sabah and eastern Kalimantan as far as the Mahakam River.</li>
                <li>Central Bornean orangutans are the subspecies with the most animals, with at least 35,000 individuals</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Why they are endangered</h3>
            <p>Poaching, deforestation, an increased conflict with humans, and a huge demand towards illegal pet trades </p> 

             <p>They are found in an isolated area of the northern part of the island of Sumatra. There are fewer than 800 individuals making them among the most endangered great apes.</p>
