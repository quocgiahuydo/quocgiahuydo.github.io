        <p>Sunda tigers are distinguished by heavy black stripes on their orange coats. The last of the Sunda island tigers are holding on for survival in the remaining patches of forest on the island of Sumatra. Accelerating deforestation and rampant poaching mean this noble creature could end up extinct like its Javan and Balinese counterparts.

            In Indonesia, anyone caught hunting tigers could face jail time and steep fines. But despite increased efforts in tiger conservation—including strengthening law enforcement and antipoaching capacity—a substantial market remains in Sumatra and other parts of Asia for tiger parts and products. Sunda tigers are losing their habitat and prey fast, and poaching is an ever-present threat.   </p>
        <h3>Why they are endangered</h3>
            <p>Lack of habit to breed and prey because of illegal timber harvesting and deforestation. Sunda Island tigers were also killed by poachers for commercial gain along with human-tiger conflicts because of the lacking habits. 
</p> 

             <p> The majestic Sunda tiger who used to be accompanied with the Bali and Javan tigers, is now the last tiger population in Indoesia’s Sunda Islands. Surprisingly, the Sunda or Sumatran tiger is one of the smallest species of tigers with males only averaging 2.3 meters long and weighing 240 kg. Sunda tigers are distinguished by heavy black stripes on their orange coats along with their darker furs. Similar to other tigers, only one in ten hunts is a success, meaning that Sunda tigers fill themselves with as much meat as possible when feeding. It’s believed that they’re able to eat as much as 35 kg of meat in one sitting. Sunda tigers have noticeable beards around their faces and live up to 15-18 years.
