    <p>## Inspiration
        No reason, we just love animals
        ## What it does
        Raises awareness for endangered animals while also giving a platform to help educate about what's currently happening to other species that we share the Earth with.  
        ## How we built it
        We used API to make a globe and JAVA to enable it with interactable coordinates used CSS and HTML to make a landing and proceeding webpage. We used matplotlib in python to make the regression graphs to predict endangered animal populations. 
        ## Challenges we ran into
        Attempting to make an interactive globe and finding a idea that fits. This was our first hackathon as freshmen's and we only really had a grasp of pygame and python. Everything was overwhelming at first till we got an idea started and begin to learn other languages that could help us accomplish our goal. 
        ## Accomplishments that we're proud of
        Just being here and being able to accomplish a website by ourselves. 
        ## What we learned
        How to use API, Frameworks, HTML, Text app, collaboration, regression formulas (intro to machine learning), etc. 
        ## What's next for Shared Earth
        More detailed analysis for endangered animals while also adding on factors that causes animals to be endangered such as global warming and deforestation. The whole project was heavily rushed causing us to leave out plenty of ideas and details. Moving forward we hope to continue updating this website in  our vision and to find more solutions for both ourselves and others towards helping endangered animals.
