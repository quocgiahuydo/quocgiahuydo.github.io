        <img src="/images/javan rhino.jpg" alt="Javan Rhino" class="img_main">
        <p>Javan rhinos are the most threatened of the five rhino species, with 
            only around 70 individuals that live only in Ujung Kulon National Park in Java, 
            Indonesia. Javan rhinos once lived throughout northeast India and Southeast Asia. Vietnam’s
             last Javan rhino was poached in 2010.This species is a dusky grey color and has a single horn 
             of up to about 10 inches. Its skin has a number of loose folds, giving the appearance of armor plating.
              The Javan rhino is very similar in appearance to the closely-related greater one-horned rhinoceros, but 
              has a much smaller head and less apparent skin folds.</p>
        <h3>Why they are endangered</h3>
            <p>Poaching, habitat loss, disease, inbreeding, and existing habitats that aren’t large enough to signify significant growth for Javan rhinos. Javan rhinos are the most threatened of the five rhino species.
